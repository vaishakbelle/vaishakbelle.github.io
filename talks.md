For **seminars, invited talks** and other **announcements,** I mostly use [twitter.](https://twitter.com/vaishakbelle) *But* for posterity sake, I also keep [this report](https://spikenow.com/collab/?id=SIjnWE9remXL6vPKrgF3FIYvY9B1tSApaCFpyvyQIDQ). -->

A few **video recordings** of the talks can be found [here (for invited talks)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI5qUrwTNc7PBkjEhOHsF8xZ0rwc8zWzy) and [here (for conference presentations)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI5qUrwTNc7NoPeQYyfBObap4sCdsw5xJ).

## Symbolic Logic meets Machine Learning 

## Tutorial to be held at [KR-2022](https://kr2022.cs.tu-dortmund.de) 

### Abstract 

 The tension between deduction and induction is perhaps the most fundamental issue in areas such as philosophy, cognition and artificial intelligence (AI). The deduction camp concerns itself with questions about the expressiveness of formal languages for capturing knowledge about the world, together with proof systems for reasoning from such knowledge bases. The learning camp attempts to generalize from examples about partial descriptions about the world. In AI, historically, these camps have loosely divided the development of the field, but advances in cross-over areas such as statistical relational learning, neuro-symbolic systems, and high-level control have illustrated that the dichotomy is not very constructive, and perhaps even ill-formed. In this tutorial, we survey work that provides further evidence for the connections between logic and learning. Our narrative is structured in terms of three strands: logic versus learning, machine learning for logic, and logic for machine learning, but naturally, there is considerable overlap. 


## Course Contents 

Motivation & background, logic vs learning (including weighted model counting), learning for logic (inductive logic programming, bayesian scoring, PAC-semantics), logic for learning (probabilistic programming, algebraic model counting, abstraction) 


## Who is this for

The course looks at fundamentals and assumes knowledge of propositional and first-order logic. [Cf chapter to see contents covered.](https://vaishakbelle.com/attachments/03-Belle.pdf)

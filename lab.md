The Lab carries out research in **artificial intelligence**, by unifying ideas from **machine learning** and **symbolic systems (logics, programs & plans)**, with a recent emphasis on *explainability* and *ethics*.

<img src="/uni.png" width="450"> 

We are motivated by the need to augment _learning_ and _perception_ with _high-level structured, commonsensical knowledge_, to enable systems to learn faster and more accurate models of the world. We are interested in developing computational frameworks that are able to _explain their decisions, modular, re-usable_, and _robust_ to variations in problem description. A non-exhaustive list of topics include:

*   probabilistic and statistical knowledge bases
*   ethics and explainability in AI 
*   exact and approximate probabilistic inference
*   statistical relational learning and causality
*   unifying deep learning and probabilistic learning methods
*   probabilistic programming
*   numerical optimization
*   automated planning and high-level programming
*   reinforcement learning and learning for automated planning
*   cognitive robotics
*   automated reasoning
*   modal logics (knowledge, action, belief)
*   multi-agent systems and epistemic planning

For example, our recent work has touched upon: 

*   [morality in machine learning systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03736) 
*   [tractable learning with relational logic](/attachments/pacfol.pdf) 
*   [deep tractable probabilistic generative models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.05464) 
*   [learning with missing data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.05847)
*   [program learning for explainability](/attachments/ilp2019.pdf) 
*   [implementing fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07026)
*   [model abstraction for explainability](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.02434) 
*   [strategies for interpretable & responsible AI](/attachments/biochem.pdf)

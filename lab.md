**TL;DR:** Here's a one-slide summary of our recent work:

The Lab carries out research in **artificial intelligence**, by unifying **learning** and **reasoning**, with a recent emphasis on _neuro-symbolic AI_, _causality_, *explainability* and *ethics*.

We are motivated by the need to augment _learning_ and _perception_ with _high-level structured, commonsensical knowledge_, to enable systems to learn faster and more accurate models of the world. We are interested in developing computational frameworks that are able to _explain their decisions, modular, re-usable_, and _robust_ to variations in problem description. Here is a slightly more granular view of the research that we do, where  neurosymbolics AI sits at the intersection of learning and reasoning + our emphasis  on expressive languages.

A non-exhaustive list of topics include:

*   probabilistic and statistical knowledge bases
*   ethics and explainability in AI 
*   exact and approximate probabilistic inference
*   statistical relational learning and causality
*   unifying deep learning and probabilistic learning methods
*   probabilistic programming
*   numerical optimization
*   automated planning and high-level programming
*   reinforcement learning and learning for automated planning
*   cognitive robotics
*   automated reasoning
*   modal logics (knowledge, action, belief)
*   multi-agent systems and epistemic planning
*   integrating causality and learning 

For example, our recent work has touched upon:

*   [implementing fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07026)
*   [model abstraction for explainability](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.02434)

## We’d be lucky to have you! 

Our lab is always looking to grow with interested and motivated folks, so please send me an email if you think your interests align. 

## How to reach me 

Please send all enquiries via email (with CV; include titles of any published or unpublished works) 
- with the subject [Interested in PhD] OR [Interested in Masters by Research]
- along with the mention of a concrete area (e.g., neuro-symbolic AI) and if possible a specific topic (e.g., for reasoning about causality in images) 

## What’s helpful for me

In reaching out to me, it would be helpful if you explain (briefly)

- why you want to work with us specifically,
- what you've worked on,
- what you'd be interested in exploring going forward, and
- how that would fit in with what I've been working on.

It’s okay if you are interested in an area rather than some paper of ours (e.g., I’m interested in probabilistic databases, temporal planning) - it’s helpful to be as concrete as possible. 

## Funding 

Please specify if you are seeking funding. Outside of the opportunities listed below, there are a range of avenues for pursuing a PhD, including through the School of Informatics, or the Centres for Doctoral Training (CDTs) in Data Science, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Robotics, and Biomedical AI. 
Please refer to the information on these pages to learn about the application process, timescales, and funding options. I don’t get to see your application for the CDTs until it has been selected for interview, so it’s best to check with me first about your research statement. Also note the deadlines are often in Dec and Jan, so best to check early. 

## MSc (Thesis)
If you're already an Informatics MSc student looking for a thesis project, please check if I have any submitted topics first. 


## Funded positions
I had a funded position on neuro-symbolic AI that was closed in Oct 2022; if anything else comes up, I’ll post it here and on twitter.

## Postdoctoral postions 

I had a funded Postdoc position on logic and learning that was closed in June 2022; if anything else comes up, I’ll post here and on twitter.

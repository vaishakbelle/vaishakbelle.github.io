title: CP paper on generating random (logic) programs 

---
 

Paulius' work on algorithmic strategies for randomly generating logic programs and probabilistic logic programs has been accepted to the principles and practise of constraint programming (CP2020). A combinatorial argument for the correctness of the ideas as well as comparisons of existing inference algorithms on benchmarks problems is also consisted.

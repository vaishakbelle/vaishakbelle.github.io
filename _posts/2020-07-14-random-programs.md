title: CP paper on generating random (logic) programs 

---
 

Paulius' work on algorithmic strategies for randomly generating logic programs and probabilistic logic programs has been accepted to the principles and practise of constraint programming (CP2020). The work is motivated by the need to test and evaluate inference algorithms. A combinatorial argument for the correctness of the ideas is also considered.

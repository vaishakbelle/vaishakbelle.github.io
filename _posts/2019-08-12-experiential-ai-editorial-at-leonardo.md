Drew, Ruth, Larissa, Dave, Frank and I have an editorial accepted on experiential AI at the Leonardo journal. It observes that morality is not very much explored by the current generation of artists working on learning algorithms, and so, the understanding of moral machines will be the theme of the first programme in experiential AI.

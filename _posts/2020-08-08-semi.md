title: Journal paper on Semiring programming

---
 
A journal paper has been accepted that positions a new framework we call *semiring programming*, which extends probabilistic programming with connectives taken from any semiring. This then allows us to capture a wide range of search and combinatorial problems considered in AI, including inference, SAT, convex programming, weighted model integration etc, in a single unified programming model.

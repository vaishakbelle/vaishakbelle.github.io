A journal paper on abstracting probabilistic models has been accepted. The paper studies the semantic constraints that allows one to abstract a complex, low-level model with a simpler, high-level one. The framework is applicable to a large class of formalisms, including probabilistic relational models. The paper also studies the synthesis problem in that context. [Preprint here.](/papers/)

[Hybrid Reasoning for Intelligent Systems, 2017](https://www.hybrid-reasoning.org/en/events/10th-workshop/)  

I gave a talk and a tutorial at the Hybrid reasoning workshop at Aachen, Germany.

I discussed the applications of probabilistic programming for automated planning, and for the tutorial, I covered approaches to unify logic and probability.

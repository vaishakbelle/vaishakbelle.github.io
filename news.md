Happy for Nijesh to have had a paper "Satisfiability Modulo Theory Meets Inductive Logic Programming" accepted at IJCLR. We've been thinking about how to integrate linear constraints and real-valued constraints in inductive logic programming. And Nijesh has been working out a general solution for this.

Automated sentiment analysis can help efficiently detect trends in patients’ moods, consumer preferences, political attitudes and more.

**Two papers on probabilistic inference at UAI-2021**

Jonathan’s paper considers a lifted approached to weighted model integration, including circuit construction. Paulius’ paper develops a measure-theoretic perspective on weighted model counting and proposes a way to encode conditional weights on literals analogously to conditional probabilities, which leads to significant performance improvements.

**Paper on weighted model counting at SAT-2021**

Weighted model counting often assumes that weights are only specified on literals, often necessitating the need to introduce auxillary variables. We consider a new approach based on psuedo-Boolean functions, leading to a more general definition. Empirically, we also get SOTA results.

**May 5, 2021**

This then allows us to capture a wide range of search and combinatorial problems considered in AI, including inference, SAT, convex programming, weighted model integration etc, in a single unified programming model. [Preprint here.](https://vaishakbelle.github.io/)

**CP paper on generating random (logic) programs**

Paulius’ work on algorithmic strategies for randomly generating logic programs and probabilistic logic programs has been accepted to the principles and practise of constraint programming (CP2020). The work is motivated by the need to test and evaluate inference algorithms. A combinatorial argument for the correctness of the ideas is also considered.

**May 7, 2020**

**AKBC paper on learning credal sum-product networks**

Our paper (joint with Amelie Levray) on learning credal sum-product networks has been accepted to AKBC. Such networks, along with other types of probabilistic circuits, are attractive because they guarantee that certain types of probability estimation queries can be computed in time linear in the size of the network. The problem we tackle is how the learning should be defined when there is missing or incomplete data, leading to an account based on imprecise probabilities.

**May 5, 2020**

**Journal paper on abstracting probabilistic models**

A journal paper on abstracting probabilistic models has been accepted. The paper studies the semantic constraints that allows one to abstract a complex, low-level model with a simpler, high-level one. The framework is applicable to a large class of formalisms, including probabilistic relational models. The paper also studies the synthesis problem in that context.
